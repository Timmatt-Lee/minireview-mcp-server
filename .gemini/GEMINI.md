## Gemini Added Memories

- When asked to merge, land, or commit code to GitHub, my workflow is: create a new branch, commit the changes, push the branch, create a pull request, and enable auto-merge. I must use available command-line tools (like `gh`) to complete the entire process.
- All text inside source code files (including code, comments, docstrings, and string literals like decorator arguments) MUST be in English. Only my direct chat responses to the user should be in Traditional Chinese.
- To re-record VCR cassettes, use the command: `pytest tests --record-mode=rewrite`
- Never lower the test coverage threshold. Always write new tests to meet the required coverage.
